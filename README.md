# Node.js + TypeScript + Express + Cypress + Gherkin + Nunjucks + Bootstrap

Just having a little spike/play with putting these things together in a mixing bowl and seeing how it tastes.

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:WillGibson/nodejs-typescript-express-cypress-gherkin-nunjucks-bootstrap.git 
    cd nodejs-typescript-express-cypress-gherkin-nunjucks-bootstrap
    npm install

## Start the app

    npm run start:watch

This will recompile and restart the app any time you make changes to the source files.

## Run the Cypress tests

    npm run test:cypress:open

Then you can just click `All.features` or a specific feature to run the tests. They will re run automatically any time you make a change to one of the test files.
